# Self-Driving-Cars

This Repository includes five challenging and independent projects for Self-Driving cars,
1. Lane-line Detection
2. Traffic Sign Detection using Tensorflow
3. Driver Behavior Cloning using Keras and Udacity Simulator
4. Advanced Lane-line detection
5. Vehicle Classification, Detection and Tracking

To get started, install the Udacity anaconda environement (or just libraries) from [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md).

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
